12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,I greatly appreciated Professor Jones' enthusiasm about the course matter and I felt like I was able to learn very effectively under him.
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,The class was very interactive and engaging. I was always thinking about something in a way I hadn't thought about before.
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,Learning the Book of Jonah and Jude. Both stories were great to learn and dissect!
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,Dr. Jones has made the course very meaningful and interesting encouraging interaction in class and working hand in hand with the students so that learning is at the utmost priority.
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,The most meaningful part of this course was the ENCOURAGEMENT the class received from Allen. He assured us that we are completely capable of studying the Bible on our own so long as we apply the methods we've learned.
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,I felt like this course was so helpful; as a person who grew up on the bible but wasn't as close to it in my teens it became my favorite class at Corban. I found it very helpful.
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,"The most meaningful parts of the course were when we went over the book of Jonah initially. Student participation was highly encouraged and we got to see everyone's perspectives pre-reading the book of Jonah. Around the midterm, after learning about Jonah for months, we circled back around and had a similar discussion with very different results! It was crazy to see the premier and exponential growth not just in myself but also in my classmates on how to interpret not just Jonah, but the Bible in general."
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,Allen knows how to help students understand his course materials effectively and strategically. He gets everyone involved in class and it serves to be beneficial for individual students and the class as a whole.
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,"I found this entire course very valuable. It was extremely helpful and taught me a lot about how to read and share the bible in a beneficial way. And overall, good life lessons were taught."
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,The push for students to go beyond what they knew - regardless of where they were and what they knew at the beginning of the semester - and gain a deeper understanding of the Bible. I don't believe a single student in my class left without having some sort of eye-opening experience about how they approached the Bible and their study of it.
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,The importance of self-reflection encouraged me to grow through my bible understanding to see where I was lacking in my biblical life.
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,"The lecture is always the most interesting part of class, as i found the required readings to be busy work. I throughly enjoys the class discussion"
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,The most meaningful part of this course was the application and relation from what we were learning in class to how we read the Bible. I am now ore equipped in my ability to study the Bible
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,"I really enjoyed his class. I liked how the book provided more information about the topics discussed in class. I also like the part where he makes everybody engage at least once in his class, which makes it more fun."
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,It was cool to grow up with the Bible my whole life and now have a better understanding of how to read and interpret it.
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,"The connection he made with our class. Allen Jones engaged the class very well and it seemed important to him to know each of us and to understand the class. He explained everything very well, so learning was easier to process and it made going to class something I looked forward."
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,I loved the way Allen taught it. The class made me look at the Bible from a different perspective and what I will need to be doing when I read the Bible.
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,The connections made with real word examples really helped me understand topics that may otherwise be confusing.
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,I loved the way that Allen Jones conveyed the entire class into a discussion. It is almost impossible not to learn in Allen's class. An amazing teacher and human being that God blessed me in having as my professor.
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,Class dicussion
12/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,The course allowed me to grow as a Christian and was one of the few classes I looked forward to attending.
12/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,"NO, i actually loved how he structured the class and made it where everyone could learn about the bible."
12/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,I honestly don't have suggestions for improvement. I thought this course was amazing.
12/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,Nothing really at all Allen covers all bases of learning on the matter that I can think of.
12/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,I have nothing it was by far my favorite class Allen made it fun and enjoyable.
12/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,"I have no suggestions as I thought this course was exploratory in my learning. I could see more books from the Bible being added to the course, but at the same time, it may overwhelm students. Being able to learn so much from two books was, while challenging, very doable and effective."
12/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,"I have no suggestions in how to improve this course. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and what I learned,"
12/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,"Nah, no complaints here"
12/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,I have no suggestions!
12/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,none
12/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,"Nothing, this was my favorite class I had this semester and everything was done very well."
12/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,Nothing. The layout and setup of the class were awesome and very easy to understand.
12/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,"I don't think it would be fair to offer any, since this was the last semester. It was a fantastic class, and I think we'll all be sad to see you go."
12/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,Maybe more of a variety in assignments.
12/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,"None, a hard subject taught in a easy manner."
12/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,I suggest discussing the book a little in class; it would make it easier to connect the two.
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"Dr. Jones is the best professor I have had in my time at Corban and the best teacher I have had in my life. Dr. Jones makes every class meaningful and makes you feel like you need/want to be in class otherwise there might be some important information you will miss. No dull spots in the class everything is related and important. Dr. Jones also cares immensely about the students learning the material rather than anything on his own. You can tell he cares about the student's learning and understanding. Dr. Jones is also the most intelligent person in his field, and you can tell he is passionate about what he knows making every class feel like he really does care (which he does!). I really couldn't give enough praise to Dr. Jones because he has really changed the way I view classes and gave me a fresh look at biblical classes in general. Dr. Jones has made me pivot in my academic career and that speaks numbers as opposed to any grade I could ever get."
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"Thank you for making a tough class fun, I'm sorry that I won't have you for the other three and a half years of my college, but know that you'll live on somewhere in my memory. Best of luck in your future, someone is going to be incredibly lucky to land you as a professor - Kenny."
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"Nah, I'd win"
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"This has been my favorite class, so engaging and insightful."
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"Professor Jones is one of my favorite professors here. He encourages everyone in the class to participate, which helps everyone better understand the material he is teaching."
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,Allen Jones was an amazing professor. He engaged with the whole class and his style of teaching kept the class engaged throughout the whole class duration. The way he teaches breaks down the lesson in a way that is easy to understand.
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"Allen Jones is one of the best teachers I have ever had. He made class fun and interesting. He explained everything so well I never felt behind in class or left confused. Out of all my classes I gained the most from Bible Study Methods and now I can use the skills I learned in the future. I appreciate how he made each and everyone of us feel important in class. He is an awesome professor and he is very passionate about the Bible, which helps make learning more fun. I'm going to miss not having him as my professor next semester. He engaged our class very well. Everyday leaving class I was always in a good mood due to the positive atmosphere he created."
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"I loved this class; it was my favorite class of the semester. Allen made everyone feel heard, valued our participation and knew us by name, which is rare. It was engaging and fun and forced us to use our thinking skills. It was centered around the Bible, and we always took prayer requests at the beginning of class, which was very encouraging and helped me get to know my classmates better. Overall, this class taught me so much, and I had a great time."
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"My abilities, perceptions, and beliefs were challenged and strengthened in this class. I'm beyond thankful that I had the chance to experience your teaching before you left Corban. I pray God will continue to be with you as you enter a new stage of life!"
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,Talking out loud was sometimes challenging.
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,none
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"I enjoyed both the course and the professor who taught it. It's important to teach something like this, and it's just as important to have an instructor who puts in the effort to connect with students and actually TEACH them the concepts they are supposed to learn. Both the class and the instructor will be missed."
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,You're the best Allen!!!! Will be missed.
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,AMAZING TEACHER! :)
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"I liked how the instructor made everybody talk and moved us around, which made people talk to others they normally wouldn't talk to and then made the classroom more cohesive."
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"If I could take another Allen Jones class, I would in a heartbeat. There was not a single class where I didn't want to go because I knew that every class period was going to be fun and action filled. He even made less active classes (more lecture filled classes) fun to be in. He speaks to students in a way they will understand and relate to. I loved Allen's personality and the joy he filled the room with was contagious."
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,I recommend every Corban Student to take this class.
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"Allen's great and he built a relationship with everyone in the class. He clearly knew what he was talking about, and it's sad to see him go."
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,being called on randomly throughout the semester made me pretty anxious
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,Allen is an amazing well depth professor on this subject. Allen is truly a treasure trove of knowledge regarding the Bible.
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,none
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"I absolutely loved and enjoyed this class, I feel as though I am ready to accomplish any biblical task I may find myself in."
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"Thank you, Professor Jones!"
12/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"Allen is a great teacher, he is easy to talk to and he treats his students as equals."
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,The most meaningful parts of this course were the topics that were talk about. I have ever been a part of a class that has gone so in-depth about what its means to be a women and how much the Bible supports woman despite what society believes
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,everything
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,"I can truly say that every day in this class was meaningful. I learned so much this semester. One of the very most meaningful parts of this course was when we had the opportunity to share are struggles anonymously, showing that we are not alone in those struggles, it was a beautiful thing. Another really meaningful thing is the semester long project, Corban's slogan is to educate Christian to make a difference in the world for Jesus Christ and in this class, we get the opportunity to do that with are project."
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,"This class promoted high levels of engagement, discussion, and questions. Questions were encouraged, any every one was treated as highly valuable. The most meaningful part of this class was the project and ability to truly make a difference in the lives of women. This project taught students discipleship, the ability to lead, and the importance of working within community. This class also brought up topics that are often seen as too uncomfortable to discuss. In this I learned a lot that I have not been able to learn before, as well as this class prompting me to further investigate what I believe on my own. I gained understanding of the Bible, as well as desire to greater dive into it. Overall my relationship with God grew and my identity as God's daughter."
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,"I really appreciated the sections on women and silence. I believe that a lot of the things that we learned in this class aren't talked about enough within the church, most of them I had personally never had a discussion about."
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,I really liked getting a chance to truly make a difference in the world. The way that our groups worked on a specific project on our own time while learning about the topic within class was very appreciated in that it helped us be better at our projects to make a bigger difference in the world. This class allowed a deeper understanding of the topic so that we may be knowledgeable and hopefully be able to make a difference even after the semester has ended.
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,"Honestly, every single aspect of this class is going to leave a lasting impact on me in a good way. I learned so much from this class and I will continue to learn about feminism and the bible because this class as inspired me to look into the topic more and more."
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,"The main project is designed to push the students out of their comfort zone and outreach, which for a bible class, is meaningful and should be more common."
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,The class discussions were extremely meaningful and provided excellent opportunities for growth and learning.
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,"I loved how we could go out and make a difference in the real world instead of just talking about making a difference in the real world. We were also able to address hard-to-talk-about topics with the whole class, where we were able to share our experiences and thoughts in a safe environment."
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,The integration of the Bible into the real world including misinterpretations. I also found the project very meaningful. It made us do something that was impactful for women and others in need.
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,I always enjoy classes with Allen. He is a wonderful teacher and mentor. I will miss him when he's no longer at Corban.
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,"The most meaningful parts of the course were diving deeply into different passages, learning about the context, and discussing the validity of different viewpoints."
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,Allen Jones is the best biblical professor this school has. Losing him will be a bigger detriment to every single student who attends this institution for years to come. Feminism and the Bible has brought me deeper into my faith than I ever thought possible. Throughout this semester we discussed the most controversial Bible verses within the Bible but we also addressed why there are never discussed in sermons. Allen helped us to come to the conclusion that maybe society is sensoring congrigations because these verses are hard to digest at first glance. The irony in this situation is now that Corban is doing the same by getting rid of the one class this university has to offer that actually addressed head on the blatant issues outlined in the Bible between the authority of woman and what scripture says.
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,I genuinely love having Jones as a professor especially in this course. He allows so many different perspectives and allows us to understand our own opinion and be able to back it up. I think that his teaching is very rare and something that is very valued. I don't think anyone could teach this class as well as he has. I honestly am very frustrated that he has to go and I think that Corban will have a huge gap from now on due to the loss of his teaching.
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,I was able to further develop my worldview and my belief on certain biblical texts.
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,The deeper dives we took into the Word were especially meaningful to me and realizing what the passages truly meant.
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,"Allen openly spoke about the importance and impact that false teaching has done to women, he was biblically sound while also allowing the class to gauge and interact and talk about topics in a respectful atmosphere that was willing to listen."
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,"I truly appreciated being able to learn about all of the topics from the course and from different perspectives. As someone who never really talked about the topic of feminism and the bible, I found that this course has helped me be able to form my own opinions and what the Bible says too. My favorite part of this course was the project. Although it was difficult having to do it all in only a few months, the project has helped inspire me to want to continue helping people whether it's through volunteering or even getting together with other people to help out an organization."
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,All of it :)
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,"This is a course that some may think would have been controversial. It truly changed my perspective on how we are to combine the two topics. I knew that this course was going to be a challenge and provide difficult topics, but it was formative to take the worldview we have as Christians and to challenge them against difficult current day topics we face in the broken world specifically for women. Thank you so much for being vulnerable and engaging with the Lord guiding your steps."
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,"The parts of the course that I found most meaningful were the discussions on purity culture and women in the church. For the majority of my life, purity culture was pushed onto me through the teachings of pastors, youth leaders, and children's teachers. I was led to believe that my purity was one of the most important parts of my identity as a believer. I was taught that the status of my virginity was the deciding factor of my value. Yet as much as they pressed staying ""pure"" on us girls, they contradicted themselves by teaching that real women didn't struggle with lust. In class, we were able to disseminate those teachings and false beliefs in a very impactful way, in a way that I have yet to see from any other person involved in ministry or teaching. We also discussed women in church, and what their role is. I have often been taught this from a complementarian perspective, but rarely have I heard from an egalitarian perspective. It truly brought new light to an issue I thought was all said and done; it helped me reevaluate my standpoint by being able to see these passages through another lens."
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,"I liked the first week of the class, but after that, I pretty much did not enjoy the class."
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,"I was constantly learning something new everyday, which isn't very common for me despite the fact that I am attending a university."
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,I enjoyed how the professor pushed me outside my comfort zone and how my knowledge of the bible has grown
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,"Honestly, this whole class was really good. My favorite part (outside of the academic knowledge) was probably the purity lecture."
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,Whenever Allan finally started to talk to us he made very insightful points
12/15/2024,BIB305,best_part,"This course had many meaningful parts but the main and most clear is the expectation to go out and be involved in making a difference. This involved becoming aware of a problem, coming up with a plan to make an impact, and executing such a plan. Being able to work in a team is a challenge in and of itself. But when real lives are being affected, the challenges are emboldened. This course was meaningful in its capability to equip me for the real world."
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,"nothing, i enjoyed the course and am glad I took it"
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,I sent emails to him and I never got responses back
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,more time so that we can finish our daily objectives!
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,I can't think of any
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,none
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,I have no suggestions. Allen is a wonderful professor and truly cares about understanding Gods word and each of his students.
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,I did not personally like the assistant brought in due to her teaching that appeared biased and leaning to her own beliefs and point of view on the topic.
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,"Personally, I enjoyed the way the class was led, from the big project to the readings we had to do every week. I think there was a good balance between assignments and the project. I also really enjoyed the class discussions and the small group discussions as it allowed me to be able to hear the perspectives of other students, and to also hear the perspective of the professor without feeling forced to only believe one thing."
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,More lectures. I appreciate hearing Allen's insight.
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,Maybe just more proactive efforts from the professor on the group project but even that is such a minor suggestion.
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,It would be helpful to bring someone who has different beliefs or more complementarity beliefs into the class to share their thoughts as well.
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,"Make it a Tues/Thurs class so we have more time, class felt too short"
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,"Knowing that over 50% of my grade was based on one thing is stressful. My group members were good people but had more free time to be able to project than I did. I put everything I could into the project that I could give, and that looked different to work on the net than my other group members. I wish there were other assignments to help my grade out."
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,"- please just have Allen come back and teach it, literally no one else would be as good as a fit as he was."
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,N/A
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,I think reports during class weekly about our project would help us stay on track and possibly get other groups to collaborate with each other.
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,There isn't a lot of consideration regarding students' concerns about their grades.
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,"Maybe don't fire the one professor at Corban that has gone beyond his privilege as a man to help both women and men to understand the Bible from a genuine standpoint that doesn't force you to ""justify the Bible""."
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,"I don't think there is anything to change, it was GREAT!"
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,If you do this class again please find a teacher who - like Allen and Ellen - are more interested in making us think/process both/multiple sides of the issues instead of telling us what we should believe. The mostly neutral presentation method was incredibly invaluable for such sensitive issues.
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,"If there was more time this would be incredible! But there is not. As for the class content, the flow of thought was great, easy to follow and challenging in how it was discussed. Challenging in the sense that I had to dig in and think hard, applying myself to the readings and all assignments."
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,I'm going to miss Allen.
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,I wouldn't have this course if Jones isn't teaching it.
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,n/a
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,"Man, all I can say is that I wish we had more time."
12/15/2024,BIB305,improvement_suggestions,"I suggest a woman teach this class. I feel like he made it about himself a lot of times, and some of the things he said were questionable."
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"I wish you, Allen, a wonderful future path with much fulfillment and growth with God."
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"I wish you, Ellen, a blessing of peace and wisdom as to how to live yourself and guide others."
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,Ellen and Allen were absolutely amazing professors in this class. I would do anything to take more classes with them. They taught me so much and I cannot thank them enough for what they do. Allen is incredible and seeing him go is very sad. This has been one of my favorite classes and I will never forget it. Thank you so so so much.
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"i'd take this class over again, like a part two of it."
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"This course is genuinely one of the best courses I've ever taken. Dr. Jones is a phenomenal asset to the Corban community and I am very disappointed to see him go. He challenged us to think critically and Biblically in ways that we might have never thought before. He approached this class with such humility and willingness to learn with us, and it showed in his teaching. I am so grateful for this course and think that everyone should take it"
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"Loved the class, I appreciate that he brought on a female teaching assistant to provide a better view on the subject."
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"Allen Jones is a truly wonderful professor that the students here at Corban will dearly miss. Jones is particularly adept at creating a culture within the classroom of critical thinking and engagement. He strives to hear from every student during every class period and he values the input of every one of them. Jones truly knows his Bible very well and is extremely knowledgeable, yet his classes aren't lecture-based and he doesn't tell us what to think. He inspires discussion and challenges us to think for ourselves and come to a fully informed conclusion. It is evident that Allen Jones cares deeply about his students, not only for their academic success but their mental and spiritual well-being too. He will be an absolute blessing wherever God takes him next and I thank him for an absolutely wonderful semester."

12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,Thank you for teaching this class!
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,I learned so much! Thank you for teaching this class
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"I loved this class and am so glad that I was able to take it. Allen Jones is one of the best professors I have had, and I have learned a lot from him. Even though he is a male teaching a class on feminism, I do not believe many would have been able to do a better job. He has obviously studied and learned a lot about this topic with an open mind to all of the biblical possibilities. He is able to keep his own opinions out of the conversation and teachings so that we may be able to form our own opinions without his influence. I am really glad that our groups had the chance to truly help other people. We would have had to take a class anyway, so I really enjoyed the chance to be able to help others with that time that we would have used to just sit in our living room and read a textbook."
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"Allen, thank you so much for teaching this class, I am really going to miss having you as a professor. I am truly blessed to have had you for BSM and now Fem & the Bible, you have taught me so much and helped me grow my relationship with the Lord. Thank you for not only teaching me so much but also making it fun, making us laugh, and challenging us in our walk with the Lord. I pray that the Lord gives you peace as you transition to something new, I know you will impact so many more lives while continuing to glorify the Lord. I really wish you were staying not only so I could learn more from you but so future students here at Corban could learn form you as well because the Lord has truly given you the gift of teaching His word. I'll end with this, thank you for taking time to know, pray, teach, and share Gods love with your students, you will be very missed."

12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,Allen is a great professor and this class truly framed to make a difference.
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"Jones is a wonderful teacher and really cares about the students. I think that he actually cares the most out of all teachers. He knows my interests in fighting human trafficking, and he will go out of his way even during summer to send me podcasts or articles about it. I have not seen any other teacher do it this way. I feel very challenged in his classes which is another thing that I see a lot of professors lacking in. This project wasn't my favorite but it did help me learn a lot and I wish we had more professors who challenge us and our ideals like he does."
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,I always have one or two classes each semester that really stick with me and visibly build my opinions and values as an individual. Feminism and the Bible was one of those classes for me this semester.
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"Allen's class was teaching me something outside of my worldview everyday. It's obvious how he cares for his students not just in their academic lives, but in their personal lives. I appreciated the way he had us engage with the material everyday. After taking this class, it made me wish I had taken other classes with him in the past. He is a fantastic professor that cares about his students' wellbeing outside of academics a well as inside the class room."
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"I appreciate the final project in terms of motivating us to make a tangible difference in the world for Christ and for women, and I know that it will be graded on a curve, but I am still overwhelmed by it and worrying about my grade."
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"The instructor of this course not only explored challenging topics with sympathy and passion, but highly encouraged his students that even if they having opposing stances from him, he continued to allow them to share without judgement. He provided a safe place in the classroom and outside where students felt at liberty to participate. When teaching, Dr. Allen Jones is able to teach the content in several different ways where all students of different learning styles are able to understand and participate. He is also able to teach the content through different perspectives too, allowing students to not only learn about the content, but to be able form their own opinions by being provided with resources from different sides of the conversations. Overall, professor Dr. Allen Jones is a good teacher, a well-knowledged, and respectable person overall admired by students and professors."
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"As an Ed major it was quite inspiring to watch him team , I learned so much about the topics but also how to be a better teacher as well."
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,I enjoyed this course. It challenged my thinking about the Bible and helped me find hidden meanings within certain passages that I never thought about at first glance.
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"Allen Jones is truly an amazing instructor and follower of Christ. I'm not exactly sure what the details are in regards to why he is not being allowed to continue his tenure at Corban University, but as a student I can confidently say that the presence of Allen Jones Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 2-2:50, although was short, it will be some of my most cherished time. And I will forever be grateful for Allen Jones, a man, taking the time to help women to better understand the meaning of scripture and ease the feeling that we are second-class citizens in a world that is constantly striving to tell us otherwise."
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,When someone says that their instructor is incredibly caring to each student it may also mean that they neglect the expectation for academic excellence. Not with Jones. He is a professor who both cares and keeps his students accountable to put in the work.
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,Dr. Jones is a humble man who connects with his students well. I have had many intentional conversations with him that have built me up as a follower of Christ. He does not allow for busy work. It is evident he has pours his heart and his mind into his teaching curriculums. I am thankful for Dr. Jones and all the classes I have been honored to be in. I will miss him dearly.
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"Allen is extremely humble, open minded and open hearted. I really enjoy every class I have with him. He engages and encourages us in every class, recognizing and remembering every student. He made me feel seen and heard."
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"The class was overly emotional, and it got annoying how he kept telling us repeatedly that he shouldn't be teaching this class. I was disappointed by the outcome of this class. I was excited by it at first, but then it just felt like an emotional class, and sometimes I felt uncomfortable. Everyone is on a different journey and season, and I thought it was rude to read people's struggles, even if they are anonymous. I also thought that some of the hard weeks were forced and that some content was not appropriate for the class title. I am not to write things like this, but there was a week when he read a letter, and it was evident that he forced himself to cry. It was very uncomfortable, and it looked fake. Did not feel natural at all. I welcome emotions and talk about hard things when they are authentic and real. I felt like I was forced to feel or even be a part of something that did not feel real or natural."
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"Thank you for everything Allen, we'll miss you for sure."
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"I found the class to be very enjoyable, but there were a few instances where I was confused by my professor's theology or did not quite find it biblical."
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"Allan, you are the GOAT"
12/15/2024,BIB305,other_comments,"Overall this has been my favorite class that I have taken at Corban. The professors do an incredible job at allowing students to choose their beliefs in the end, as well as simply shining a light on what the Bible has to say on each topic. This class with Allen Jones also provoked a curiosity that I haven't seen in other classes. Every class, without fail, students came in excited to learn and speak about what was being discussed. I have rarely seen a group of students so interested in what a professor is teaching, and in what their peers have to say. I hope that this class continues with Allen teaching it, so that the lives of students may continue to change as they become closer to God."
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,"Learning how to do word studies from the original language, learning the importance of locations in scripture"
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,"I think that the gradual increase of biblical tools was very useful. Allen made sure we were confident in one area before moving onto the next and I really appreciated that. I think it is super awesome how fast Allen learned our names and remembered who had for hadn't spoken in class yet that day. The homework/work load wasn't too bad either, and each class was very interactive and fun!"
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,The active engagement so you didn't have an excuse to nod off in class.
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,learning how to study one book of the bible in depth
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,Learning more in-depth about the bible including how to read and perceive different texts.
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,"Everyday Dr. Allen Jones shows so much joy in teaching us and sharing Gods word. You can really tell how much he cares about his students and spreading the word of God. I can honestly say each day I learned something new. This class inspires me to know the Lord more and provides me with the tools I need to do so. The most meaningful parts are our discussion, and we have that every day in class! Dr. Allen Jones has helped me to be more comfortable answering and asking questions in class which used to be nerve racking for me but now I am lot more comfortable with it. We also always start our day with prayer and prayer request and students get the option to pray for the class which I really enjoy!"
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,learning how to study the bible better
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,I really liked how deep we went into things and referenced the lessons to different parts of the bible instead of spending the entire semester on one section
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,It was meaningful that students were all supposed to participate. It allowed me to think hard about topics we were focusing on and build community in the classroom.
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,being called to apply what we have learned
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,Being able to always put my opinion out there and the professor always listening and taking it into account
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,Just being able to further my understanding of the material in such a way that honestly didn't feel like learning it was taught so smoothly.
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,Learning about the different tools to study the Bible.
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,Learning how to study the Bible in a deeper way.
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,"The most meaningful part of this course was, as someone who grew up in the church, learning completely new concepts and ideas of well know Bible stories such as Jonah that I have heard an abundance of times in my life. I loved that Allen Jones could make the entire class feel a new sense of understanding to what seems like such a simple story. I loved learning new ways to study the Bible and gain new perspectives."
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,The connection my professor had made and cared about how are mental health was plus or school life as well.
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,there was a lot of meaningful things in the course that I enjoyed and I cannot chose one
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,The in-depth scrutinization of words to further understand how they can change the meaning of the passage or the mood or theme. I did indeed enjoy this class and its unique structure!
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,probably applying the books we read into our life
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,The regular everyday discussion aspect of the course
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,The writing assignments
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,"I think the most meaningful part of the course is I learned how to use the biblical tools to see, understand, share, and respond to the Bible passages. I was challenge to think critically and building my points with the context."
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,I learned a lot of different ways to break down biblical texts. This is one the better courses I have taken at Corban.
5/15/2024,BIB105,best_part,I thought the group discussions were really helpful and I enjoyed doing the word study.
5/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,"The book felt virtually useless to me as it overcomplicated the teaching from lectures. Additionally, I wish there were more 100-point assignments so that the few present had accounted for less of the overall grade."
5/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,have more fun activities
5/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,"I wouldn't change a thing! Dr. Allen Jones is an amazing professor I look forward to having him as a professor in the future. I have learned so much from this class, how to study the Bible well, being able to understand things I didn't understand before, gaining more knowledge so that I can teach others about the Bible and help them to understand it more. This class really exemplifies Corban's mission statement of educating Christians to make a difference in the world for Jesus Christ."

5/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,Change the grading system please it's a headache and is a lot of work for 3 points max and not great scores if not 3/3
5/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,I have no suggestions for the way Allen Jones teaches this course. He did an amazing job.
5/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,I don't have any suggestions.
5/15/2024,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,Everything was great! Allen was a wonderful professor and super easy to talk to.
5/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"I grew up in the church and went to a private Christian school for most of my life, and I want to say that Allen is the best Bible teacher I have ever had. He makes the class feel very interactive in a way that everyone is able to learn something new each class period. He also makes the class more interesting and engaging every day. Allen also makes the class so that we can go at a slower pace if some people still don't understand what he is teaching while also making sure we don't get behind. He always makes sure everyone has a chance to ask questions or makes sure everyone understands the information and material. In terms of the class itself, this is the best Bible class I've had to take in the entirety of my life. I love how this course teaches ways to study the Bible in which most people wouldn't think about without having taken a class like this. I really enjoyed learning new information and new ways to study what I have been studying and reading my whole life."

5/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,Prof. Jones was an amazing instructor who was great at explaining complex ideas and making every student feel comfortable in class.
5/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"Allen kept his classes interesting through class participation, everyone got a chance to answer questions (whether they wanted to or not lol)."
5/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,The instructor's teaching style is very engaging.
5/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,I am thankful that Allen Jones is a part of Corban University and that they are wise enough to keep him around for the difference that his incredible and positive influence has left on all of his students! A great professor and one I respect!
5/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,We have prayer at the beginning of every class. Dr. Jones would pray for our needs on the way to school and home. He respects every culture and has an interest in learning the difference between different cultures.
5/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,NONE
5/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,The book required made me more confused than understanding
5/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"At the beginning of the semester, I reached out to Allen about my ongoing struggle with anxiety. He took time out of his day to walk with me and talk about ways he could help ease my stress. From that day forward I knew Allen would be a person I could talk too and be open with about my anxiety and that he would be understanding of my rougher days. Allen Jones is one of the most selfless, funny, engaging, caring, and impactful teachers I have ever met. When I walk into the classroom I don't feel like I have to be perfect, just that I need to try and that will be enough."
5/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,He made sure to the best of his ability and memory to pick each student to talk in class no matter the response instead of the same people always talking through the entire class
5/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,none
5/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,I enjoyed learning more about the Bible and how to unpack it. I also really liked learning about how to do a word study and find out more about the passages I read in the Bible.

5/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"Overall I enjoyed this course, it would have been nice if there had been more grace for late assignments."
5/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"Thank you, Dr. Allen Jones, for teaching me so much! I can really see your love for the Lord and how He works through you! Can't wait to have you as a professor again and learn more!"
5/15/2024,BIB105,other_comments,"Allen Jones is the BEST! As someone fairly new to the taught standard of the bible, I was worried I would feel behind and not be able to understand this course well. Allen ensured class participation for everyone while ensuring everyone was comfortable and confident in their answers."
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,The course is effective at generating my interest. I was required to think deeply about scripture and address things that I hadn't before. I feel the methods for studying the Bible I learned will help me to think more critically in my own studies of the Bible.
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,Learning things about the bible that I have read before just in a different light
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,"Too many to count, everything, love this class"
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,"The way that Allen teaches not only makes me want to read the bible and study more, but to look more into the automatic assumptions I had already made about different parts of the bible. He is such an incredible teacher and I am so blessed to have gotten to be in his class."
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,Everything. This class was so beneficial. I learned so many methods to help learn the Bible and truly study it. I caught myself outside of class in my everyday life using the things I learned and applying it to different books in the Bible. This class helped me grow in my knowledge and love for God's Word and truly understanding what it says and reveals to us.
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,"This whole class taught me so much, but I especially appreciated the understanding that not every student grew up around the Bible, and even the ones that did have a range of understandings. My opinions and questions felt very valued and I think that helped me learn a lot more than I was expecting to."
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,Talking through the assignments and what was expected and how people have interpreted wrong in the past therefore pushing in a direction of understanding more of what he wanted us to do in each assignment. He really tried to set us up for success.
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,the tools learned on how I can study and understand the Bible on my own.
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,"Primarily, I'd say the idea of combining the ideas from old Christians with their christianeese (if you'll excuse the term) and young Christians with their thought process that's not filled with bible talk, but with other experiences. The combination of the two provided a 3 dimensional look at the Word."
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,Class discussions and group talk
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,"Being able to see Bible stories from a perspective I've never even thought of before. Class is full of epiphanies, I wish it was longer so that we had more time to discuss topics we go over."
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,"This course taught me to think about the Bible in a very methodical, critical, and active way. I now know that I can continue to read the Bible the way it is supposed to be read."
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,I felt that really getting into the two bible books were very meaningful.
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,"I enjoyed deep diving into the books of the Bible I've read before, but never looked closely into. There were a lot of ""Ohhh I never thought of it that way"" moments."
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,"I really appreciated how this class was not just lectures, but a balance of different styles of learning and it was very engaging. The professor truly cared about the success of the students and encouraged the students to actively get engaged in the content. It allowed for closer connections and relationships within the classroom that motivated others to be active in the learning process. I very much appreciated being challenged to think critically about the Bible in ways that I've never thought before."
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,The enjoyable atmosphere and the challenge it brought to learning about the Bible.
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,"In class time was great, the discussions, as well as the friendships"
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,The most meaningful part of the class for me was when Allen scratched part of the plans for a class period to have an important discussion with the class that was not related to the class.
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,I loved how interactive Allen Jones was in the class and I got a deeper understanding to start understanding the Bible on a different level.
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,"This class was easily my favorite this semester! The way Allen conducted class was fun, engaging, meaningful, and helped me retain the information better. Allen was honest with us from day one. He was open, and it encouraged an atmosphere of openness in the class. I learned and retained more in this class than any other this semester, I was challenged the most, and I enjoyed it the most. I will be using what I have learned for the rest of my life. That is incredibly meaningful to me."
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,"Loved ""pop your Jonah bubble"" day"
12/15/2023,BIB105,best_part,The most meaningful part of the course is that Jones was so clear and direct with his teaching. He engaged every student and carried us through this learning process. He treated us with respect and learned with us. He was kind. Overall a great professor.
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,None :)
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,Nothing! I thought it was well taught.
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,"I think that some of the assignments where hard to understand, and having longer to practice would be good."
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,none
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,"The grading is so harsh on the bigger assignments, which makes them especially difficult on top of the fact that simply doing the assignment is difficult."
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,There's really nothing I would change about this class. It keeps everyone involved and keeps us engaged and having to participate. I wish I would have branched out more in it and something that could have helped me with that would be to have more group discussions where we got to interact with our classmates more.
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,"Honestly, I see no need for any change. The way class is conducted, the way Allen teaches, the way the students are engaged, the way homework challenges is such a positive way, it all helped me learn so much, I wouldn't want anything to change. Keep it how it is! It's incredible! :)"
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,make the 3 point assignments not take as much time
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,More clarity on what the Professor wants us to find during our assignments. Sometimes it was really hard to understand what we were supposed to dig into more or what just needed only a little background information.
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,"In all honesty, keep doing what you're doing."
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,I could not think of a better way to teach this course. The only thing I want from it is more classes
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,Nothing. Wish there was more forgiveness with assignments though. Especially in the first few weeks when we aren't used to having them due at 6AM....
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,I do not have really any suggestions and I am not sure how I would improve the course.
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,None that I can think of!
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,"For being a bible class, this class has been the most work of any classes I have taken."
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,I think this course and the teaching for it were done well.
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,I would say allow for more feedback on the assignments somehow so I know what I am doing wrong
12/15/2023,BIB105,improvement_suggestions,I feel like this course is already very strong. My personal preference would be to have more debate between students encouraged.
12/15/2023,BIB105,other_comments,"Allen puts a big emphasis on defending our thesis, which is perfect. However, it turns out (according to my grade) that I am not at all good at defending my interpretation of the Bible, at least not as good as I thought I was. I expected the comments on the assignments to give me good feedback on how I could've done better with this, but instead they're always just a generic overview of the rubric that he uses to grade us."
12/15/2023,BIB105,other_comments,"Professor Allen is such an engaging, creative, and knowledgeable teacher, and I am so grateful that I had my BSM class with him as my professor! The class is constantly kept active an engaged- there is never a dull moment. I learned so much, and I know that everyone else in the class did too. Hands down one of my favorite classes!"
12/15/2023,BIB105,other_comments,n/a
12/15/2023,BIB105,other_comments,"Professor Jones consistently brought a positive energy to the class and as a result, BSM was one of the easiest classes to pay attention in."
12/15/2023,BIB105,other_comments,"This class was my favorite, I learned the most in this class, I was challenged the most in this class, and I grew the most because of this class. As someone with neurodivergence, the school system doesn't work well for me. The way Allen teaches and the way he is so interactive makes this class one I can actually learn from, and I will remember what I have learned. This class was the one I was always excited for, and it was my joy in the middle of difficult and stressful college life. I want everyone I know to take this class with Allen!"
12/15/2023,BIB105,other_comments,I learned so much from this class and left each class period with my brain about to explode. I think it might be helpful if a whole semester long class could be focused on narrative/poetry literature and a different class could focus on discourse literature.
12/15/2023,BIB105,other_comments,None
12/15/2023,BIB105,other_comments,"Overall a really great class for me, but really stressful at times because of how much everything is weighted. But my most engaging class so far!"
